# Database design
# SQL with Access 
I am going to provide the SQL scripts for the database design for the rental transactions, which involves one or more videos being rented to all member.
Detail rental is a bridge table that was used to resolve this relationship, and also include the relational model of this database in a separate documents. 

It also demostrates that even a widely accepted SQL standard is sometimes implemented with slight distinctions by different vendors. For example, the treatment of date formats  in Microsoft Access and Oracle is slightly diferent.

It also demostrate that adhering to the SQL standards means that most of the SQL code will be portable among DBMSes.
